Research Interests

My research interests are in theory and applications of robotics on manufacturing, which encompass robot kinematics/dynamics, robot-robot/human-collaboration. I am particularly interested in finding the inner connections between the advanced algorithms and machining qualities, which enables efficient and accurate control for robot manufacturing system and perform advanced level of flexibility that robots demonstrate.
